* #### What is git?
    * Git - is a distributed system, which controls versions. The system records changes in a file or a set of files with time.
    * This allows developers  to track modifications and return if necessary to a specific  earlier version.
   
* #### Git has three main states that your files can be in. List and explain.
    * Git has three  main states that your files may be in: committed, modified and staged.
    * 1 - Committed - Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database and ready to push.
    * 2 - Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet 'Highlighted in blue'.
    * 3 - Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot 'Highlighted in green'.
